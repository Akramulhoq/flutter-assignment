flutter counter assignment

## Task 1: "Setup"

- Installed Android Studio on my computer.  
- Downloaded and set up Flutter SDK and added it to the system PATH.  
- Installed Flutter and Dart plugins in Android Studio.  
- Ran `flutter doctor` command in the terminal to verify the setup, and everything is working fine.

### Summary of `flutter doctor` output:

C:\Users\t bazar>flutter doctor
